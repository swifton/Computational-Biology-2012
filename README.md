Computational Biology (CSE 527) is a graduate course at the University of Washington. 

## Contents
* [MLE](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Y3Mud2FzaGluZ3Rvbi5lZHV8c3VpbmxlZXxneDozMDM4MzI1NTUyNDFjNmI5) is the Maximum Likelihood Estimation algorithm applied to the problem of modeling the regulatory network of genes (the network that shows how different genes in a cell regulate each other). The model of this network can explain how genes are wired together and what exactly happens when one of them breaks.
* [Simple_consensus](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Y3Mud2FzaGluZ3Rvbi5lZHV8c3VpbmxlZXxneDoyODQ0MDllYTQzNDUwZGY0) is an algorithm that finds a position weight matrix for a motif (a DNA subsequence) in a set of DNA sequences. This folder also contains the algorithm of computing LOD scores of genetic markers and expectation-maximization algorithm of haplotype reconstruction.
* [Needleman-Wunsch](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Y3Mud2FzaGluZ3Rvbi5lZHV8c3VpbmxlZXxneDo2MjRkNjc2OGI2ZTI5YmZi) is a dynamic programming algorithm that aligns sequnces of proteins and nucleotides.
